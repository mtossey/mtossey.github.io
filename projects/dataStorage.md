This data storage is a project I made for my ICS 212 class. This program allows you to createa a person or college student. If college student is selected, then it will have you type in their first name, last name, age, major, and GPA, while creating a person will not ask for a major and GPA.Then, it will allow you to view details of a selected person, modify a person, delete a person, or sort people by first name or last name.

 While working on this project, I was able to learne several key concepts of object oriented programming, such as inheritance, dynamic programming, and polymorphism. I also learned the importance of input validation by making sure valid ages and GPAs were inputted into the system and making sure there was proper error handling in the code. Using polymorphism allowed me to treat both Person and CollegeStudent objects uniformly while still retaining their unique behaviors
