summary: "A program that calculates your taxes"
---


Through working on this project, I learned a great deal about basic programming concepts like input validation, loops, and arithmetic operations. I gained experience in using both for and while loops to iterate through user input, ensuring the program could handle multiple jobs dynamically. The for-loop structure allowed me to ask the user for the income of each job and compute taxes for each one. I also learned the importance of using while-loops for input validation, ensuring that invalid inputs, like negative income, are handled properly and the program remains robust.

I also gained a deeper understanding of how to perform calculations using variables and apply tax rates across multiple data points. I worked with variables for federal and state taxes and practiced managing cumulative values like total income, federal tax, and state tax. Additionally, formatting output to display clear information about taxes for each job helped me see the value of providing a user-friendly interface in a console-based program. This project showed me the value of careful planning and validating user input to avoid errors and ensure reliable program behavior.
