Incantation is a game I made with some friends for the "Pirate Software Game Jam 15." 
The theme of the game was "Shadows and Alchemy," so we made a game where you combine augments and elements to spells for the alchemy theme, while having shadow creatures attack for the shadow theme. So the goal of the game is to type different spells and combine them with elements and augments to last as long as possible.

  I was primarily responsible for game design and coding. This responsibilities included, planning out the game, making the projectiles, making the player movement, and more. For this gamejam, we had to create a game design document, which includes details about inspiration, art, music, theme implementation, and more. If you are interested, you can view our game design document here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/16YiW4WoZUkRunCTQ8dPai54ms6x50IZ_c0T-qdPu_k8/edit?usp=sharing

This project gave me experience on effectively communicating and working with a team, which was important in order to ensure we meet our deadline. It also gave me the experience of learning gdscript and just the general game design process on creating a game from start to finish.
