How would you like to catch bugs before you even run your code? Typescript is a programming language uses static typing. This allows developers to catch errors before running the code, which can lead to quicker bug fixes. The syntax for typescript is similar to javascript, so that helped me learn quicker. I think it is primarily a good programming language becaues requiring clear type definitions, it allows for better code readability, so working with a team is easier and faster. In my opinion, the only real downside to typescript is the increased complexity.

For intense and deliberate practice, such as athletic software engineering, the instant feedback of this programming language alone is a great tool to be able to learn quicker. I find the practice WODs to be very helpful, as they are similar to solving leetcode questions during an interview. While it is slightly stressful, it is good practice to be able to solve coding problems in a limited time, and I find them fun. This is because it is not only fun to try and solve the problem, but afterwards being able to see different solutions from people is a great learning experience. It is a great tool for me, and my only gripe with the system is that there are not infinitely generated practice WODs because it would be nice to be able to practice on different problems.
