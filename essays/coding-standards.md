	At first glance, coding standards can seem like a chore to do. One needs to make sure they have the right amount of spaces, indents, proper naming, etc. Coding standards however, I believe are one of the most important aspects of coding and one that should be thoroughly practiced. Firstly, some coding languages use indents as part of the code themselves, but even in those that do not, it is an important practice so that not only others can read your code and understand it, but so you can understand it quicker and easier as well.
	An easy way to see how this could confuse people is, imagine if there were no indentation in someone’s code. It would take quite long to read and figure out which statements are in which functions and it would just be a whole jumble of code in your mind. With this knowledge, we know why it is important to have proper indentation in our coding. After using ESlint for a week, of course I found it tedious at times, but I did not mind it because I know it is for a good future purpose. Like learning a language, it is tedious to do repetition of writing the same letters or having the same conversations over and over again, but after a while one will soon be able to use these learned phrases, words, and write newly learned letters subconsciously. With practice, I’m sure many experienced coders learn to do this subconsciously as well.
	Overall, while coding standards may initially seem tedious and time consuming, they are essential for maintaining clarity, consistency, and readability in your code and in return allow yourself and others to work quicker. Over time, with consistent practice, these coding standards and habits will soon become second nature, which leads to a smoother collaboration process. With this, you not only improve your own skills, but also inspire others and contribute to a more professional coding environment.
