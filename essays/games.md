The year is 2013, and millions of people are gathered online to find out who is gonna be the best? SKT, led by star midlaner "Faker," and Royal Club with star AD Carry, "Uzi." In a swift 3 games, SKT wins with Faker's Zed and many people witnessed the beginning of Faker's legacy. Moments like these are one of many that inspired me as a child. I thought League of Legends was an amazing game for being able to bring all these people together, and it was still growing. Since then, I wanted to be a game designer and one day create a game that people will have fun with.

As I continue my journey in studying computer science and software engineering, I have found several topics that intrigued me and I want to learn. Topics I am now interested in include game design, virtual reality, AI usage, and cyber security. While I intend, to focus on game design, I would like to study these other topics on the side. One important skill that i want to be able to develop is being able to solve leetcode problems. This is not only for coding interviews, but I believe it develops the skill of being able to critically think in certain cases and quickly problem solve.

Now, I am a 3rd year in Computer Science. I hope to gain great experience as a programmer and be able to work in a valuable internship by the time I graduate. I am excited for the future and what comes next and will continue to try and do great things.
